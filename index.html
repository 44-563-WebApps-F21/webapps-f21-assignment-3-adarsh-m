    <h3>Goa</h3>
    <p>
        Goa is a state in <b>western India</b> with coastlines stretching along the <b>Arabian Sea</b>.
        Its long history as a <b>Portuguese colony</b> prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved
        <b>17th-century </b> churches and the areaâ€™s tropical spice plantations.
        Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and
        Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda.
